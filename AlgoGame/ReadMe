# Path Finding Game

This is a Python implementation of a path-finding game using Turtle graphics. The game involves navigating a player and an opponent through a board to find a treasure while avoiding obstacles. Different search algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* search are available for the opponent to find the treasure.

## Installation

To run this game, you need Python installed on your system. Additionally, ensure you have the following libraries:

- `turtle`
- `tkinter`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the Python script using the following command:

```
python path_finding_game.py
```

3. Use the arrow keys to control the player's movement.
4. Press 'S' to start the game.
5. Use different algorithm buttons to switch between search algorithms for the opponent.

## Game Rules

- The player and the opponent can move up, down, left, or right.
- The player's objective is to reach the treasure before the opponent does.
- The game ends when either the player or the opponent reaches the treasure.
- Each successful treasure finding increases the respective player's score.
- The game supports resetting for a new round.

## Features

- Adjustable board dimensions and obstacles.
- Real-time display of player and opponent movement.
- Score tracking for both player and opponent.
- Various search algorithms for the opponent to find the treasure.
- Full-screen support using Tkinter.
